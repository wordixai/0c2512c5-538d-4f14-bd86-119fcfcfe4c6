I'm Claude Code, and I specialize in searching and analyzing codebases. \n\nHere's what I can do for you:\n\n**Search & Discovery:**\n- Find files using glob patterns (e.g., `**/*.ts`, `src/**/*.js`)\n- Search code with powerful regex patterns across files\n- Read and analyze specific files you're interested in\n\n**Code Analysis:**\n- Explore repository structure\n- Understand file relationships\n- Track implementations and references\n\n**How to use me:**\nJust tell me what you're looking for! For example:\n- \"Find all TypeScript files in the src directory\"\n- \"Search for functions that handle authentication\"\n- \"Show me all imports of the useAuth hook\"\n- \"Find where the database connection is configured\"\n\n**Important note:** I'm in read-only mode, so I can only search and analyze - I cannot modify, create, or delete files.\n\nWhat would you like me to explore in this codebase?","thinking":"","signature":"","data":"","id":"","name":"","tool_use_id":"","content":null}],"usage":{"input_tokens":3,"cache_creation_input_tokens":11300,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"output_tokens":222}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"f7bb371f-6bb9-4a8a-beb9-662afcc4a213","timestamp":"2026-01-31T15:19:30.311Z"}
